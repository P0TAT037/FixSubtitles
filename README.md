# FixSubtitles

this tool lets you fix broken (wrongly timed) subtitle srt files by delaying the subtitles by a certain amount of time to correct it's timing.

-----

Just run the tool, give it the path of the srt, give it the required delay (negative values are allowed) and it will output `FixedSubs.srt` in your current directory.
